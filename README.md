# udacity_d3_visualization

## Summary

This is one of the project work for Udacity - Data Analyst Nano Degree. The goal is to create an explanatory data visualization from a data set that communicates a clear finding or that highlights relationships or patterns. Titanic dataset from Kaggle was selected as the source data for this project.


## Design

The goals are to: 

                  1. Demonstrate if survival rate is dependent on gender, class and age.

                  2. Show passenger distribution of the above features and get some findings on passenger counts. 
Bar chart is suitable for both purposes. Through breaking down at different level, we are able to see clearly which bucket has the highest survival rate or survival counts.
So for each feature, i will create two bar charts. One for survival rate, one for passenger count.

## Findings

#### By gender

 Survival rate for female is significantly higher than male.
 Though there were more male passengers in Titanic, Female survivers are more than male.
 
#### By class
 Survival rate for 1st class is significantly higher than other 2 classes.
 Survivers are mostly from 1st class althought 1st passengers are far less than 2nd and 3rd class.
 
#### By age
 Survival rate for kids(<= 10 years old) is significantly higher than other age groups, and survival rate for seniors(>= 61) are significantly lower than other groups.
